Proof of Concept (PoC)
----------------------

	see https://github.com/tintinweb/pub/cve-2013-2023
	
	
	1) prerequesites
	     vBulletin 4.x with Tapatalk for vBulletin 4.x installed
	2) run PoC
		 edit PoC to match your TARGET (, optionally DEBUG=True)
		 (optionally) edit your query to extract specific database values
		 Note: PoC will try to detect tapatalk on that host
		 run PoC
		
	by default extracts
	* mysql root hash (in case vBulletin db user has permissions to do so)
	* vbulletin db record fields (apikey) - perfectly chains with CVE-2014-2023
	
	only limited by the vBulletin db_user access permissions
