quote website [1]

>Dropbear is a relatively small SSH server and client. It runs on a variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software, distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly useful for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as wireless routers.


Mitigation / Workaround
------------------------

* disable x11-forwarding: re-compile without x11 support: remove `#define ENABLE_X11FWD` in `options.h`
