quote website [1]

>UPnP IGD client lightweight library and UPnP IGD daemon
>The UPnP protocol is supported by most home adsl/cable routers and Microsoft Windows 2K/XP. The aim of the MiniUPnP project is to bring a free software solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol (DLNA) is also becoming very popular but here we are talking about IGD. ReadyMedia (formely known as MiniDLNA) is a UPnP Media Server using some UPnP code from MiniUPnPd.

miniupnp is being used by many applications and network attached devices like

* P2P File Sharing software
* Network Device Firmware
* Blockchain clients
